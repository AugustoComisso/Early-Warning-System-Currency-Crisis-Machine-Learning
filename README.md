External Early Warning Systems (EWSs) - balance of payments crises - Machine Learning models - Classification and Regression Trees - Bootstrap Aggregating - Random Forest - Argentina
External Early Warning Systems (EWSs) have traditionally been designed to warn policymakers of potential balance of payments crises. This study compares the performance of three different EWSs Machine Learning models using CART, BA and RF. The three models have been trained with Argentinian data between 2003 and 2023 and have shown high out-of-sample performance. In addition, using 103 macroeconomic variables, the models highlight the relevance of certain variables in the fiscal, external, real and monetary sectors as potential predictors of future currency crises in Argentina.
